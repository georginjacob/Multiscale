This repository contains the matlab codes to create the figures and the R codes to report the statictical significance in the manuscript "How the forest interacts with the trees: Multiscale shape integration explains global and local processing" 
by Georgin Jacob and S. P. Arun, Indian Isntitute of Science, Bangalore, INDIA.

## 1. Figure Code ##

This folder contains the Matlab codes to  create the figure pannels.

  **1.1 dummy shape**  : Seven representative shapes used in MDS plots when refering to global scale alone. 
  
  **1.2 subfunctions** : Dependent matlab subfunctions to used by the each of the figure panel codes.  
  
  **figure_XX**  : Matlab code (.m file) to generate each figure panel of the manuscript. 
  
  **L2_XX**      : There is an L2_xx.mat corresponding to each experiment (L2_SD.mat-exp01, LSmain.mat-exp02, L2_GLIE.mat-exp03, L2_IEpossizenum.mat-exp04, 
  L2_pos2.mat-exp05 and L2_IE_grouping.mat-exp06). This data stucture is formed by pooling the data from all the participants of the experiment.
  
## 2. Stats ## 
This folder contains the R codes used find the statistical significance. 

**2.1 Exp01_BlockwiseSameDifferent_HierarchicalShapes** : All files used to report stats based on experiment-1

**2.2 Exp02_VisualSearch_HierarchicalShapes** : All files used to report stats based on experiment-2

**multiscale_stats_summary.xlsx** : Summary of all the Linear Mixed model reported in the manuscripts.
